# Fillit
A project for 42. Find the smallest square that given tetronimos (tetris pieces) fit in to.

Fillit is a project that lets you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities,
in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to
assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
